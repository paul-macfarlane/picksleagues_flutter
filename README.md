# picksleagues_flutter

Cross-Platform Mobile app for Picks Leagues.

## Running locally

See https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install to set up Flutter on your machine.

After setting up on your machine, following instructions on the Flutter docs for running the app locally in iOS or Android.

The recommended approach for this project is to add the Flutter extension to your vs-code based IDE (VsCode, Cursor, etc). I personally recommend installing XCode (if you are on a Mac) and Android Studio (regardsless of platform) and then using the iOS and Android emulators to run the app.
